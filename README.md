# Memory Manager

School Project 

- Manage a random number of allocations and deallocations,
- Start with 64K free memory. Each time an allocation is requested, the free memory will decrease.
- Keep track of the InUse memory. The InUse memory is defined as the memory that is in use â€“ it has been allocated but not yet deallocated.
- Deallocates memory, it is removed from the InUse memory. You need to keep track of the deallocated memory.
